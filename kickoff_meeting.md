Meeting summary


Quick recap
The team met to discuss developing a tool to help A&R professionals identify and evaluate potential remix opportunities on SoundCloud. They explored technical approaches to connecting SoundCloud data with other music platforms like ChartMetric and Spotify, while considering how to handle bootleg remixes and copyright issues. The group agreed to focus on creating a dashboard that would take a SoundCloud remix link as input and output projected revenue potential, along with basic metrics and market research. They decided to split up research tasks, with Julio investigating ChartMetric, Alexey examining data sources, and Jessica focusing on case studies and licensing frameworks. The team planned to meet again at 4 PM Pacific time to discuss their findings before a scheduled meeting with Miriam about licensing considerations.

Summary
AI Tools for Showcase Event
The team discussed the use of AI tools for meeting minutes and agreed to test ChatGPT for note-taking during their Startup Showcase event. Adam highlighted the success of past showcase participants like Groover and IndyNo, and Ben offered to lead the presentation preparation. The group also addressed technical issues with audio feedback and agreed on next steps for data pulling and presentation preparation, with Alexey taking the lead on data-related tasks.

API Project Planning Discussion
The team discussed their technical backgrounds and interest in learning new tools for a project involving APIs and data sources. Alexey suggested focusing on small, specific use cases and testing APIs, emphasizing the need to decide which data sources to use. He proposed starting with a GitHub repository to compile relevant information and exploring data points that could be used for the project. The team agreed to identify good examples, determine criteria for finding remixes, and decide which aspect of the project to tackle first, such as finding remixes based on original songs or estimating remixer potential.

Remix Monetization Analysis Prototype
The team discussed developing a prototype to analyze the potential of remixed songs on platforms like SoundCloud, focusing on identifying data points that could predict a song's popularity and monetization opportunities. Jessica suggested finding an example of a remix with easily licensed rights to demonstrate the concept's viability, while Alexey emphasized the importance of testing available data sources and APIs to prove the feasibility of the approach. Ben and Julio highlighted the need to define the user journey and target audience for the product, with Julio proposing an input process where an A&R person or label representative would analyze a song's performance on SoundCloud to determine its potential for monetization. Adam clarified that the tool would not focus on licensing but rather on analyzing existing popular remixes to help rights holders or remixers make informed decisions about monetization.

SoundCloud Remix A&R Tool
The team discussed a tool for A&R professionals to identify and evaluate potential remix opportunities from SoundCloud, focusing on tracks with revenue potential and licensing challenges. Ben clarified that in the initial iteration, DJs would not directly use the tool, but it would help A&R identify tracks for licensing negotiations. The team acknowledged concerns about incentivizing bootlegging, with Ben suggesting they gather more information about how bootlegs are currently treated on platforms like Spotify. They agreed to schedule a session with Miriam to discuss licensing questions and to proceed with data analysis once they better understand the target user and use case.

Remix Tracking Dashboard Development
The team discussed challenges and opportunities around tracking remixes and bootlegs on SoundCloud and Chartmetric. They explored the limitations of existing APIs, particularly for identifying remixes and connecting them to original songs. Ben suggested that a hypothetical future feature could involve accessing SoundCloud's copyright detection infrastructure, but agreed that for the current iteration, they should focus on building a dashboard that demonstrates the capabilities based on a known good remix example. The team decided to prioritize creating a demo that shows how an A&R person could input a SoundCloud song link and receive metrics about its performance, rather than attempting to build a comprehensive list of remixes for a given repertoire.

Remix Potential Evaluation Tool Discussion
The team discussed a tool for evaluating remix potential, with Alexey and Adam agreeing that both DJ-driven creative experimentation and label-driven A&R perspectives are technically feasible. They explored using case studies, including successful remixes like "No Broke Boys" that transitioned from unofficial to official releases, to demonstrate the tool's value for market research and audience testing. The group aligned on using SoundCloud data to provide insights about remix popularity and geographic distribution, with Adam noting that this information is already available in JSON format through the API.

Project Task Assignments and Planning
The team discussed tasks and next steps for their project. Ben will research SoundCloud DRM and copyright fraud detection, create a user journey flowchart, and organize the current document. Alexey will evaluate data sources, while Julio will explore Chart Metric data for market research and projections. Jessica will draft questions for a licensing framework and prepare for a meeting with Miriam. The team agreed to meet with Miriam at 4 PM Pacific time, with Adam sharing a Zoom link. They plan to follow up with Miriam the next morning if needed.
